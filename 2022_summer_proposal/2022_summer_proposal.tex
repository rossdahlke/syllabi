\section{Course Description}\label{course-description}}

This class will combine theoretical and technical discussions and
lessons to give students the ability to conduct their own research on
digital social data. Every week we will have discussions on the
structure, content, and userbase of various social platforms and what
that means for the data that is generated from them. We will also learn
how to access data from these platforms via their web APIs. We will also
learn various ways that we can analyze these data. Finally, students
will be able to answer their own unique research questions. By the end
of the course, students should be well positioned to conduct their own
original research.

\textbf{Students should have a working understanding of the statistical
programming language R}. This class is not an introductory computing
course. We will be covering how to access web APIs and analyze the data
from these sources, but students are expected to already know basics of
computing such as data types, data cleaning, and basic analysis.

In addition, this course will primarily be using the \texttt{tidyverse}
for programming. If you are unfamiliar with the \texttt{tidyverse}
please review Hadley Wickham's \href{https://r4ds.had.co.nz/}{R for Data
Science}, which can be found for free online.

This course will be primarily taught using R. Students are highly
encouraged to use R. It is my opinion that R is the best choice for
individuals who wish to conduct research or pursue data science.
However, students are able to use Python but must be aware that they
will be responsible for finding the necessary resources in Python to
complete their assignments and project on their own.

\subsection{Grading Policy}\label{grading-policy}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{20\%} of your grade will come from Platform Reviews
\item
  \textbf{30\%} of your grade will come from the weekly lab assignments
\item
  \textbf{10\%} of your grade will come from your project proposal
\item
  \textbf{10\%} of your grade will come from your project presentation
\item
  \textbf{20\%} of your grade will come from your project paper
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{attendance-policy}{%
\subsection{Attendance Policy}\label{attendance-policy}}

Attendance is not mandatory for this course. However, Platform Reviews
will only be accepted at the beginning of class on Mondays. The labs are
intended to give you enough time to work on your lab assignment in
class. During lab you will have access to the instructor for questions,
and you are encouraged to work with other students during the labs.
